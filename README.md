### Data Science Projects - (Python)

#### Project 1 Title:
Predicting Credit Card Approvals

#### Project Description:
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning. In this project, I will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques in python, just like the real banks do. The dataset used in this project is the Credit Cards Approval Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Data Analytics projects– (R Studio)
********
#### Tasks

My R projects consist of the following tasks:

•	Cleaned/Manipulated the datasets, ran a logical analysis on the topic of interest and visually presented the results via graphs/plots. 

• Carried out a time series analysis on the given dataset (Quarto & R Markdown).

•	Installed the essential R packages for my analysis, explained its application and gave an example of its use by applying it to my chosen dataset.

•	Created my own working functions (R Markdown) for summarizing and plotting the findings of my analysis. 

• Made predictions with the help of the results obtained.


#### Research topics for my Data Analytics projects

#### Topic 1

->  Descriptive Statistics and Graphs of Baby Names in Ireland (1964-2021).

In the first exercise, we use a dataset that contains baby names (1964-2021) for the Republic of Ireland, released annually by the Central Statistics Office. Due to confidentiality reasons, only names with at least three instances in the relevant year are included. The data frame `iebabynames`is part of the [**iebabynames** R package](https://github.com/stefan-mueller/iebabynames).

#### Topic 2

->  Analysing Survey Data: Voting Behaviour during the Brexit Referendum.

This exercise uses data from the British Election Study collected shortly before the Brexit Referendum. It will help us analyse how age and education levels relate to voting "leave" or "remain". The data are described and used in Sara Hobolt's paper "The Brexit vote: a divided nation, a divided continent" published in the Journal of European Public Policy in 2016. The dataset is part of the 7th Wave of the British Election Study, constituting the pre-campaign "Panel Survey Study of the 2016 EU Referendum", conducted before the referendum. The sample size is much larger than usual election studies, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of vote choice based on age and education.

### BSc. (Honours) Final Year Dissertation
******

Research Topic – Effect of Socioeconomic Status (SES) and lifestyle on Physical and Mental Health.

Final grade: A

•	Obtained, cleaned, and balanced raw data from ISSDA (Irish Social Science Data Archive).

•	Designed 4 different models to test the relation between SES, lifestyle and health.

•	Performed regression analysis on (2 dependent and 15 independent) variables (Logistic Regression).

•	Generated 4 regression tables to present the findings of the research models and evaluated the empirical results.

### Irish Economy Policy Analysis Project
*******

Research Topic - Key challenges and/or opportunities facing the Irish economy as a small open economy operating in a globalized trading environment.

Final grade: A+

•	Researched about the contribution of the Irish tourism sector to the economy over the last 6-7 years.

•	Studied the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the Irish Tourism sector and businesses related to the hospitality industry during the last 2 years.

•	Discussed possible future policies for the post-pandemic recovery of the tourism industry.
