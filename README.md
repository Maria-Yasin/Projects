### Data Science Projects - (Python)
********
#### Project 1 Title: Predicting Credit Card Approvals

#### Project Description:
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning. In this project, I will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques in python, just like the real banks do. The dataset used in this project is the Credit Cards Approval Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

#### Project 2 Title: Exploratory data analysis using earthquake API

#### Project Description:
• Retrieval of sufficient data for analysis from your selected web API. 

• Saving dataset in an appropriate format.

• Loading dataset in an appropriate representation.

• Data pre-processing, including cleaning, filtering, and transformation of the data before analysis.

• Data characterisation, summarisation, and analysis of the data. 

• Analysis should include use of tables and visualisations where appropriate.

• Interpretation and explanation of the results. 

• Conclusions with summary of insights, challenges, and future work.

### GPX Data Webscraping Project (Python)
********

The objective of this Project is to scrape a collection of GPX files from the http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/python/EVdata web pages and perform some analysis. GPX is an XML-based format for GPS data. These GPX files have been copied from eurovelo.com. 

The EuroVelo website provides GPX files for 17 long distance cycle routes. These routes are divided into stages and the focus of this assignment is to generate summary statistics (distances and elevation) for these stages. The idea being that these statistics would help people identify stages that would meet their interests and abilities. 

#### Task 1. Data Collection

Scrape the GPX files from http://mlg.ucd.ie/modules/python/EVdata. There are 17 Eurovelo routes so you should get 17 GPX files. You may find BeautifulSoup to be useful for this task. The 17 GPX files should be stored in a data folder/directory where they can be accessed for the summary statistics task.

#### Task 2. Generate summary statistics 

Some of the summary statistics generated in the project are given below:

What is the longest stage in EuroVelo 6?

What is the stage in EuroVelo 1 with the most uphill?

What are the three flattest contiguous stages in EuroVelo 2?

Find the five hilliest (most uphill) contiguous stages in EuroVelo 1.

### Data Analytics projects– (R/R Studio)
********
### Tasks

I have experience working on data analytics projects in Python and R. In these projects, my main tasks typically involve:

•	Data cleaning: This includes tasks such as handling missing or incorrect values, converting data types, and dealing with duplicates or outliers.

•	Data wrangling: This involves transforming and preparing data for analysis, such as merging multiple datasets, reshaping data, and creating new variables or features.

•	Exploratory data analysis: This step involves analysing and visualizing data to gain insights and identify patterns or trends.

•	Statistical modelling: Depending on the project, I may build predictive models or conduct hypothesis testing using statistical techniques.

•	Web scraping: Used libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy to carry out tasks such as identifying data to be scraped, handling website structure, parsing data, and handling errors.

•	Created my own working functions (R Markdown) for summarizing and plotting the findings of my analysis. 

• Made predictions with the help of the results obtained.


### R Programming Short Project
**********

#### Topic 1

->  Descriptive Statistics and Graphs of Baby Names in Ireland (1964-2021).

We carry out exploratory data analysis using a dataset that contains baby names (1964-2021) for the Republic of Ireland, released annually by the Central Statistics Office. Due to confidentiality reasons, only names with at least three instances in the relevant year are included. The data frame `iebabynames`is part of the [**iebabynames** R package](https://github.com/stefan-mueller/iebabynames).

#### Topic 2

->  Analysing Survey Data: Voting Behaviour during the Brexit Referendum.

This exercise uses data from the British Election Study collected shortly before the Brexit Referendum. It will help us analyse how age and education levels relate to voting "leave" or "remain". The data are described and used in Sara Hobolt's paper "The Brexit vote: a divided nation, a divided continent" published in the Journal of European Public Policy in 2016. The dataset is part of the 7th Wave of the British Election Study, constituting the pre-campaign "Panel Survey Study of the 2016 EU Referendum", conducted before the referendum. The sample size is much larger than usual election studies, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of vote choice based on age and education.


### R Programming Election Studies Project
**********

#### Topic 1

-> Irish National Election Study: Support for Irish Reunification

In the first exercise, we use data from the Irish National Election Study 2020 (see: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/E6TAVY). 

As a consequence of Brexit and recent political developments, many observers discuss the possibility of Irish reunification. In this exercise, I will analyse which voters tend to support or oppose reunification. We use a sample of 1,000 respondents from the Irish National Election Study.

#### Topic 2

-> Do Women Promote Different Policies than Men?

(Based on Raghabendra Chattopadhyay and Esther Duflo 2004. “Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India.” Econometrica, 72 (5): 1409–43.)

In this exercise, we will estimate the effect of having a female politician on two different policy outcomes. For this purpose, we will analyze data from an experiment conducted in India, where villages were randomly assigned to have a female council head. The dataset we will use is in a file called india.csv. The list below shows the names and descriptions of the variables in this dataset, where the unit of observation is villages.

### Machine Learning Project (Python)
********
#### Topic: Encoding Category Features

#### Objective
The objective of this project is to assess the effectiveness of different strategies for encoding categorical features. The encoding strategies to be assessed are One Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding and CatBoost Encoding. The assessment will be done on the dataset provided " breast-cancer.csv".

Tasks
- Using a Naive Bayes classifier and the OneHotEncoder and OrdinalEncoder packages from scikit-learn assess the performance of these encodings using a 50:50 split of the data (i.e. use 50% of the data for testing). 

- The performance assessment should be done multiple times and an average result reported. 

- Repeat the assessment from Task 1 using the CatBoost Encoder.

- Repeat the tests on the three encoder classifier combinations considered in Tasks 1 and 2 but with the encoders fitted after splitting the data into train and test sets. The encoders should be fitted on the training data only. 

- Plot all the results in a bar-chart. Comment on the overall conclusions that can be drawn from these evaluations.

### Data Visualisation Project (Tableau)
********

#### Data Visualization task using flight data (2015-2017)

Using the Flights2015-2017 dataset create visualisations to answer the following 
questions: 

1. Which airline has the most flights?

2. Which airline has flights with the longest average distance?

3. Which day of the week has the fewest total flights? Is this consistent across 
the three years?

4. Which scheduled departure time of the day (HOUR) is associated with the 
longest average delays (Arrival Delay)? Is this consistent across the three 
years?

5. Which airline has the most delayed (Status = Delayed) flights? Does this 
airline have the most flights overall?

6. Among cancelled flights (Cancelled = 1), what is the most common 
cancellation code? Is this consistent across the three years?

### Vega-Lite Dashboard Project (Videogame dataset)
********

The goal of this assignment is to create an interactive ‘dashboard’ style visualisation to enable analysis and exploration of a dataset related to video game sales.
This visualisation contains three linked charts that interact with each other – a scatter plot and two bar charts.

•	The scatterplot shows each games’ sales in the EU and Global Sales.

•	The bar chart on the right shows the total number of games in each Genre. Clicking on a Genre on the bar chart should filter the scatterplot on the left so that only the games from that Genre are shown. This should also update the bar chart on the bottom of the image, e.g. selecting Racing in the bar chart should update the visualisation.

•	The chart at the bottom of the image is a bar chart that shows the total number of games released each year. It should be possible to do a brush select on this chart to select games released within a certain time period. This select should update the contents of the other two charts, i.e. hiding the games that were released outside the selected range from the scatterplot and updating the genre bar chart to only count games that have a release date within the selected range.
